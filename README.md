# 🕹️ Retro Portfolio

Welcome to my Retro-Style Portfolio!
I built this website to showcase my projects and have some fun experimenting with old-school design vibes.

This portfolio was made entirely using HTML and CSS — no frameworks or fancy tools — mainly as a practice project to sharpen my front-end fundamentals.

I plan to improve it soon by adding JavaScript for interactivity, animations, and a more dynamic experience.

Feel free to explore my projects and watch this portfolio evolve over time!
